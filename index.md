# Simulation Task Meta-Data Packages

This repository contains the current prototyped draft specification
for an [SSP][]-based layered standard for simulation traceability
information exchange.  Note that this specification is actively
being worked on, and thus subject to change without notice.

The [specification][spec] is maintained on [GitHub][github] and is
published [here][spec]. It is based on the [SSP 1.0][SSP10] standard.
