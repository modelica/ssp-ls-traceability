**Phase 3 step 1 Define Design Specification Simulation Integration**

In this process step, the design specification for the simulation integration is determined from the requirements. It is defined how the models and their parametrization are implemented in the simulation environment, how the elements interact with each other, and how tests and simulation are initialized, performed and evaluated.
This step 3.1 Design Specification Simulation Setup should be the first in Phase 3 "Define Design Specification for Simulation Setup". In this step further requirement specifications and also design specifications for the models, parameters, test cases and the simulation environment are defined. In practice, this is an iterative process of the steps in Phase 3. Step 3.1 Design Specification Overall Simulation Setup is the bracket over the other steps in Phase 3.

**Process execution:**
- Definition of design specification for simulation integration (models, parameters, simulation environment, and their interaction)
- Definition of design specification for quality assurance for integration requirements (simulation setup, models included)
- Documentation of reasons for design specifications
