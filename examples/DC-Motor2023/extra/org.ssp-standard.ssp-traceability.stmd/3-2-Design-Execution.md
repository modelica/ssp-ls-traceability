**Phase 3 step 2 Define Design Specification Simulation Models**

In this process step, the design specification for the simulation model is determined from the requirements. Important here is the documentation why the respective type of realization was chosen. Conceptual implementations can be used for design specification decisions. They are handled in separate sub-tasks.

There are two kinds of inputs for this step. Firstly, the information about the simulation setup in which the model should finally run. This information is needed to clarify and give background information for the design specification. Secondly, the information about the requirements for the specific simulation setup in which the model has to be developed and the specific model assurance has to be performed.
As an output also the specific subset of the design specification of the other steps of phase 3 has to be provided (simulation integration, parameters, test cases, simulation environment). This information is needed for clarification for the implementation of the model. This is an iterative process between all steps in phase 3. The results are documented in the specific steps.

**Process execution:**
- Definition of design specification for simulation model and according sub-models (structure, interfaces, design specification of models)
  - This also includes, for example, processing sequences
- In the case of usage of the models in several projects or with partners also IP-protection has to be considered
- Definition of design specification of quality assurance for model, sub-models i.e. tests
- Check if available parameters fit chosen design
- Create necessary subset of information for model implementation from the outputs of the other steps of phase 3
