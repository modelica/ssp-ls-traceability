**Phase 1 "Analyze Simulation Task & Objectives** 
Phase 1 "Analyze Simulation Task & Objectivescontains information and a description of the engineering task of the higher-level engineering process as well the general requirements and objectives, e.g. KPI and other criteria for the simulation task (see also 2.1).

**Outputs:**
- **Specific, detailed description of product, requirements and environment (meant is the environment of the real product, e.g. for car -\> road, climate zone, user group, frequency of use, …)**
  - A variant of a mild hybrid drive based on the DDC platform is to be developed. This application is a low cost variant. In this simple example no further details are provided.

- **Analyzed simulation task and objectives (including KPI and other criteria)**
  -  The simulation Task (sub-task) here is to make a pre-selection for a suitable DC electric motor in the early phase of the project. It is to be examined whether the DC motor with the type part number XY12346 is suitable in principle.
  - The DC motor must be able to accelerate from 0 to 1000 rad/s within 1 s at 48 V applied voltage and a load torque of 1 Nm.
  - Parameter: New motor after 20 min running-in and 20 degrees Celsius.

- **Detailed explanation why simulation was chosen as solution approach for the engineering task**
  - **Rationale:** Same approach in similar engineering tasks was performed successfully.

- **Specific quality aspects for the simulation task derived from the criticality of the decision of engineering task**
  - Proof of the basic applicability of the motor is required before further development work is required. Sufficient validation of the results and tools used by expert opinion and plausibility tests.

- **Credibility documentation:** Procedure documentation with quality assurance
  - The results and procedure were approved by simulation expert and product expert.
