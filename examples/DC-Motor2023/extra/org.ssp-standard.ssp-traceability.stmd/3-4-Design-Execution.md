**Phase 3 step 4 Define Design Specification Test Cases**

In this process step, the design specifications for the test cases are determined from the requirements. In some cases, predefined test cases are already committed. Here it is important that the corresponding requirements for the models and simulation infrastructure are consistent.
As an output also the specific subset of the design specification of the other steps of phase 3 has to be provided (simulation integration, models, parameters, simulation environment). This information is needed for clarification for the implementation of the test cases. This is an iterative process between all steps in phase 3. The results are documented in the specific steps.

**Process execution:**
- **Definition of design specification for test cases (the test case or optimization or analysis criteria targeting the simulation objective)**
  - Here the test and how the KPIs from the simulation run are determined must be defined (evaluation).
  - In this simple example there is no difference between Requirement and Design Specification. 
  - For more extensive tests the structure of the tests (reuse, modularization) should be defined here.
- Description of tests in a complete and executable form
- Definition of design specification of quality assurance for tests
- Create necessary subset of information for test cases implementation from the outputs of the other steps of phase 3
