**Phase 3 step 4 Define Design Specification Test Cases**

**Inputs:**
- **Design specification for test cases (the test case or optimization or analysis criteria targeting the simulation objective**)
  - In this simple example there is no difference between Requirement and Design Specification. For more extensive tests the structure of the tests (reuse, modularization) should be defined here.
  - **Target Simulation:**
    - The simulation starts with all state variables 0 (current, speed, position). 
    - Voltage 48 V and load torque 1 Nm is applied. Simulation should run for 1.5 sec. 
    - Evaluation if after 1 sec 1000 rad/s are reached.

- **Specific quality design specifications for the test cases**
  - Test cases and evaluation approach have to be proved by experts.
