**Phase 2 step 5 "Define Requirements for Simulation Environment"**

In step 5 "Define Requirements for Simulation Environment" of phase 2 the framework conditions, the relevant assumptions and the requirements that the simulation must fulfill are clarified. Also, the requirements of the simulation task are broken down into the individual requirements for the simulation environment. This is an iterative process between all steps of phase 2.

**Process Execution:**
- Clarification of framework conditions, the relevant assumptions and the requirements that the simulation must fullfill
- Break down of the requirements of the simulation task into the individual requirements for the simulation environment
