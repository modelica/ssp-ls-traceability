**Phase 2 step 3 Define Requirements for Parameters**

In step 3 "Define Requirements for Simulation Parameters" of phase 2 the framework conditions, the relevant assumptions and the requirements that the simulation must fulfill are clarified. Also, the requirements of the simulation task are broken down into the individual requirements for the parameters. This is an iterative process between all steps of phase 2.
In this process step the requirements have to be clarified for:
- Quality assurance of the parameters or the chain from the data source to the parameter
- The implementation aspects,  when for example material data is processed for the data input of the models
- Parameter structures that are used according to model structures
- The infrastructure for handling different parameter sets (parameter management)

**Process Execution:**
- Clarification of framework conditions, the relevant assumptions and the requirements that the simulation must fulfill
- Break down of the requirements of the simulation task into the individual requirements for the parameters and handling of parameters
