**Phase 3 step 3 Define Design Specification Parameters**

In this process step, the design specification for the parameters is determined from the requirements. Here it is important to know how the quality assurance of the parameters or the chain from the data source to the parameter is realized and how the quality of the parameters is determined. The implementation aspects are important when for example material data is processed for the data input of the models, parameter structures are used for model structures, or the infrastructure for handling different parameter sets has to be defined.
As an output also the specific subset of the design specification of the other steps of phase 3 has to be provided (simulation integration, models, test cases, simulation environment). This information is needed for clarification for the implementation of the parameters. This is an iterative process between all steps in phase 3. The results are documented in the specific steps.

**Outputs:**
- **Design specification for parameters**
  - The necessary data is taken from the XY12345 DC motor data sheet.
  - The resistance value is taken at 20 degrees and after 20 minutes of operation (running-in time) (0.2 Ohm).
  - The brush friction at 20 degrees and after 20 min operating time (running-in time) is taken 0.007 Nm. The bearing friction is added to this value.
- **Design specification for parameter specific simulation set up**
  - No specific environment necessary.


- **Credibility documentation:**
  - **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
  - Open point, has to be fulfilled.
