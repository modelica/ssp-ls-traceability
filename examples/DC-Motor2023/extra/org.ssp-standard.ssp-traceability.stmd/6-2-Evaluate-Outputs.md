**Phase 6 step 2 Assure Simulation Quality**

In this process step quality assurance for the simulation task and result is performed. Quality information about the simulation experiments is provided, according to the criticality of the decision of the simulation task. As input the results from process step 6 of phase 4 "Assure Simulation Setup Quality" and step 7 of phase 4 "Derive Simulation Setup Quality Verdict" are used:

- Quality assurance for simulation setup according to requirement and design specifications
- Quality assurance results
- Quality verdict about simulation setup (models, parameters, test cases, simulation environment)

Main focus is then the influence of the specific settings (parameters, operating points, solver settings, …).

This can be domain or company specific.

**Outputs:**
- **Quality information of simulation results**
  - Quality assurance requirements were met: 
    - Potential risk and damage in case of misjudgement limited (additional development effort < 4 person weeks). 
    - Sufficient validation of the results and tools used by expert opinion and plausibility tests.

- **Credibility documentation:**
  - **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
