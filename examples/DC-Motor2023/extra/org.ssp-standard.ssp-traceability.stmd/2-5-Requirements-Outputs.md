**Phase 2 step 5 "Define Requirements for Simulation Environment"**

In step 5 "Define Requirements for Simulation Environment" of phase 2 the framework conditions, the relevant assumptions and the requirements that the simulation must fulfill are clarified. Also, the requirements of the simulation task are broken down into the individual requirements for the simulation environment. This is an iterative process between all steps of phase 2.

**Outputs:**
- **Requirements for simulation environment**
  - Co-simulation environment for FMUs and SSP.

- **Specific quality requirements for simulation environment**
  - Assurance of the results and used resources by expert assessment and plausibility tests is sufficient.

- **Credibility documentation:**
  - **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
