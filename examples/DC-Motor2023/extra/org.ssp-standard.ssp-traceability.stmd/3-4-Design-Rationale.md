**Phase 3 step 4 Define Design Specification Test Cases**

In this process step, the design specifications for the test cases are determined from the requirements. In some cases, predefined test cases are already committed. Here it is important that the corresponding requirements for the models and simulation infrastructure are consistent.
As an output also the specific subset of the design specification of the other steps of phase 3 has to be provided (simulation integration, models, parameters, simulation environment). This information is needed for clarification for the implementation of the test cases. This is an iterative process between all steps in phase 3. The results are documented in the specific steps.


**Rationale / Reasons**
- Standard approach for this kind of simulation task.
