**Phase 1 step 2 "Verify Analys"**

In step 2 "Verify Analysis" of phase 1 the outputs and credibility documentation of phase 1 are verified and the result is documented. Verification can be, for example: Are all objectives selected appropriately? Has the procedure documentation been checked? A formal verification is often necessary from the point of view of quality assurance.
If the results are needed for quality gates or similar predefined by a (company specific) quality process, they have to be prepared in this step.

**Outputs:**
- **Result of analysis verification**
  - Result of verification by domain expert was positive without further remark.
  
- **Credibility documentation:**
  - **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
    - In this simple example, the results were checked by another domain expert (4 eyes principle).
