**Phase 4 step 6 Assure Simulation Setup Quality**

In this process step quality assurance (i.e. tests) for the simulation environment with integrated models and parametrization is performed. Quality information about models and simulation environment according to the criticality of the decision of the simulation task is provided. This can be domain or company specific.

**Outputs:**
- **Quality assurance for simulation setup according to requirement and design specifications**
  - Expert opinion on quality assurance by DC-Motor and simulation expert.
- **Quality assurance results**
  - no findigs, positive expert opinions
  - sufficent due to low criticality of possible consequences 

- **Credibility documentation:**
   - **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
