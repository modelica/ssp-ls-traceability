== Decision Task Meta Data File Format

The __Decision Task Meta Data__ file (short: DTMD file) is an implementation of a GlueParticle for decition tasks. It is specified to support traceability, quality assurance and re-usability for decision tasks in terms of a credible decision process as it is specified in #Document Reference#. The following sub-chapters describe the structure of an DTMD file.

=== DecisionTaskMetaData

The DecisionMetaData element is the all enclosing top level XML element of DTMD files.

[#sec-dtmdgeneralinformation]
==== GeneralInformation

The GeneralInformation element is used to encapsulate general information about the decision task, which is not part of any specific phase or step.

For the details of the GeneralInformation element structure and attributes see chapter <<sec-generalinformationtype>>.

[#sec-dtmdanalysisphase]
==== AnalysisPhase

In the analysis phase, the decision-relevant information is taken from the higher-level commissioning engineering process and the essential decision-relevant requirements and goals of the decision task are derived from it. It is important that at the end of the analysis phase the essential decision requirements and the objectives of the decision task fully and clearly understood.

The AnalysisPhase element documents all relevant information.

[#sec-dtmddefinitionphase]
==== DefinitionPhase

#In the definition phase the development or decision / test strategy is defined. This means that a set of individual tasks is defined. From their individual results an overall evaluation can be made. The term development task or decision / test task is broader and can include all kinds of development and V&V methods with real elements (experiment, road test, ...) as well as virtual ones with simulation. The specific information and requirements for the individual tasks are then defined and handed over to the individual tasks. #
