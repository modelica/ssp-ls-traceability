== Overview of SSP Traceability

As improving traceability of design decisions and simulations is one the core objectives of the SSP Traceability specification, a consistent and compatible documentation of decision processes and the simulation processes that produce decision-relevant simulation results is essential.

[#sec-glueparticle]
=== GlueParticle Approach

To enable the documentation of process-relevant information and resources for a Credible Decision Process or a Credible Simulation Process the SSP Traceability Specification introduces the GlueParticle Approach:

* The **GluePartice Approach** is a concept for bundling and file-based transfer of process-relevant information and resources of a Credible Decision Process or a Credible Simulation Process.

* A **GluePartice** is a bundle of process-relevant information and resources for a Credible Decision Process or a Credible Simulation Process.
The form in which this bundle exists, e.g. whether it is stored as a file or in a database or a specific data format, is not specified.

* A **GlueParticle file** is a GlueParticle that is in a file-based representation and can therefore be transferred between tools or organizational units such as people, departments, or companies.

* File-based resources linked by a GlueParticle file should be exchanged with the GlueParticle file itself to **take full advantage** of the GlueParticle transfer.

NOTE: Although the idea of the GlueParticle approach does not depend on a specific data format or representation in general, the SSP Traceability Specification defines a set of data formats for the file-based representation of a GlueParticle content, i.e. process-relevant information and resources.
The reason for this is firstly that the Modelica Association uses XML as a general encoding format for the representation of standards specific data and secondly that SSP Traceability uses System Structure and Parameterization (SSP) Standard 1.0 resources and concepts that are also encoded in XML.
Independently of this, SSP Traceability files in general and GlueParticle files in particular could use any other applicable data encoding format, e.g. JSON etc.

The SSP Traceability specification specifies a set of data formats that can be used to document or link process-relevant information and resources for a Credible Decision Process and a Credible Simulation Process introduced in <<sec-crediblesimulationprocessframework>>.
The data formats are specified as a set of XML Schema files according to the W3C (https://www.w3.org/) XML Schema standard <<XMLSCHEMA1.1>>.

The main data formats specified by this specification are:

D**ecision **T**ask **M**eta **D**ata **(DTMD):: XML format representing process-relevant information to the Credible Decision Process (see <<sec-dtmdintroduction>> for an introduction and <<sec-dtmd>> for the detailed specification).

S**imulation **T**ask **M**eta **D**ata **(STMD):: XML format representing process-relevant information to the Credible Simulation Process (see <<sec-stmdintroduction>> for an introduction and <<sec-stmd>> for the detailed specification).

A third XML format defined by the SSP Traceability specification is:

S**imulation **R**esource **M**eta **D**ata **(SRMD):: XML format representing metadata for resources (see <<sec-srmdintroduction>> for an introduction and <<sec-srmd>> for the detailed specification).

In order to use recurring description elements consistently, they have been defined in a separate XML Schema that is referenced by the three XML Schemas mentioned above.
As a result, these description elements are also available in the DTMD XML Schema, the STMD XML Schema, and the SRMD XML Schema. The XML Schema for common content is named

S**imulation **T**raceability **C**ommon **(STC):: XML Schema representing recurring description elements of the other tree XML Schemas(see <<sec-stcintroduction>> for an introduction and <<sec-stc>> for the detailed specification).


XML files that are compatible with the DTMD or STMD XML Schema are referred to as **GlueParticle files.**
SRMD data format instances **are not** referred to as GlueParticle files.
The STC data format is never instantiated as an individual XML file. 

<<im-ssptraceabilityfiles>> summarizes and illustrates the cross-file structure and dependencies of the SSP Traceability data format set and its appropriate file instances.

A GlueParticle file represents the structure of a process to be documented.
This means that it is structured in a similar way as the process, i.e., it contains elements for documenting process-relevant information and resources related to phases and steps of the process, supplemented by some additional elements for information about the life-cycle of the GlueParticle information, cross-functional general information and additional administrative information, such as signatures, classifications and annotations. 

A GlueParticle file with its embedded or linked information and resources can be used in a number of use cases, including to

* Transfer information about the current state of a process across an organization, i.e. between teams, departments and business units, or even between companies if both units support the GlueParticle approach

* Pass process-relevant information from one IT tool to another, if both tools are able to read and write GlueParticle files

* Support product, system, and simulation engineers and reviewers in understanding a design decision or simulation process

* Document the quality of a process and thus the quality of the results and outcomes of a process

* Understand the actual execution of a given process in case it is to be re-executed partially or entirely, or if parts of the process are to be re-used or adapted for similar decisions or simulations.

At any given time, a GlueParticle represents a snapshot of an available process-relevant information and resource stack.
A GlueParticle does not contain its own full version history.
A GlueParticle version history is built by a sequence of GlueParticles instead, each of them representing a separate snapshot of the information and resource stack.
Thus, the GlueParticle version and version history management is subject of IT tool functionalities, not of the GlueParticle itself.
Each time new information or a new resource reference is added to a GlueParticle, actually a new instance of the GlueParticle is created, representing the most recent snapshot of the available process-relevant information and resource stack.

<<im-glueparticle>> illustrates the correlation of the Credible Simulation Process and the Simulation Task Meta Data (STMD) files as the corresponding GlueParticles files.

[#im-glueparticle]

During the Credible Simulation Process, simulation task metadata is generated and stored as STMD GlueParticles in a data management system.
As the Credible Simulation Process evolves, a new GlueParticle is created each time metadata needs to be stored.
Thus the sequence of GlueParticles representing process-relevant information and resource stack snapshots correlate to the process progress.
The content of the GlueParticles grows more and more with every new instance of the GlueParticle within a given GlueParticle sequence, illustrated by the increasing number of orange stars in <<im-glueparticle>>.

[#sec-dtmdintroduction]
=== Decision Task Meta Data

<<im-dtmdbriefschema>> shows the top-level structure of the DTMD XML Schema, which is the structural definition for DTMD GlueParticle files.
The structure of a DTMD GlueParticle represents all five phases of the Credible Decision Process and, as further specified in <<sec-dtmd>>, each element representing a phase has a phase-specific substructure, that represents the process steps within the phase. See <<sec-dtmd>> for a detailed specification of the DTMD GlueParticle file structure.

=== Simulation Task Meta Data

<<im-stmdbriefschema>> shows the top-level structure of the STMD XML Schema, which is the structural definition for STMD GlueParticle files.
The structure of an STMD GlueParticle represents all seven phases of the Credible Simulation Process and, as further specified in <<sec-stmd>>, each element representing a phase has a phase-specific substructure, that represents the process steps within the phase.
See <<sec-stmd>> for a detailed specification of the STMD GlueParticle file structure.

[#sec-srmdintroduction]
=== Simulation Resource Meta Data

<<im-srmdbriefschema>> shows the top-level structure of the SRMD XML Schema, which is the structural definition for Simulation Resouce Meta Data files.
SRMD files are used to define essential metadata for resources that can help users quickly understand the content and intent of a simulation resource through human-readable attributes without having to examine the resource in detail.
For example, this support can reduce the effort required to analyze a set of resources received with a simulation request and simplify the selection of appropriate resources from a resource library.

However, the existence of Simulation Resource Meta Data files is not tied to the actual referencing of corresponding resources by DTMD files or STMD files.
Simulation Resource Meta Data files can also exist for resources regardless of whether the corresponding resource is actually referenced or not.
See <<sec-srmd>> for a detailed specification of the Simulation Resource Meta Data file structure.

An important type of simulation resource is a simulation model.
There are a number of standards, each defining model metadata for simulation models in a specific way.
A common set of core simulation model metadata has been defined under the name "MIC Core", which is based on the concept of the "Model Identity Card" (<<MICCORE2023>>).

[#sec-stcintroduction]
=== Simulation Traceability Common

The STC XML Schema defines a set of elements reused by the other three XML Schema files for multi-instanced information blocks.
See <<sec-stc>> for a detailed specification of the STC elements.

[#sec-ssplayeredstandard]
=== GlueParticle Packaging

The SSP Traceability Standard is a so-called layered standard on SSP, i.e. it extends the scope and coverage of the System Structure and Parameterization Standard (SSP Standard) by additional concepts.
The boundary conditions emerging from this approach are described in <<sec-ssplayeredstandard>>.
One of the boundary conditions refer to the packaging format.

GlueParticles, by their nature, are not self-contained, but reference many resources that they tie together in their function as GlueParticles.
Packaging GlueParticles together with their referenced resources into easily exchangeable packages is therefore of fundamental importance.

The current packaging approach is based on the SSP 1.0 standard, which also serves as the basis for other aspects.
<<sec-ssptraceabilitypackaging>> details how GlueParticles can be packaged in SSP archives, either standalone or in a way that allows these archives to be treated as native SSP packages by SSP-aware processors.
Ways to package GlueParticles in other container formats such as FMUs are also specified.

=== GlueParticle Linkage

GlueParticles tie the referenced resources together in a two-fold manner:
The broad flow of dependencies from inputs via procedures to outputs, supported by rationale information is given by the explicit structure of the step elements.

This broad dependency chain can be enhanced via more fine granular links through the XLink mechanism based link sections that are present in each step and phase. XLink is an existing W3C (https://www.w3.org/) Standard, that is applied here.
See <<XLINK>> for details of he nature and application of XLinks.
