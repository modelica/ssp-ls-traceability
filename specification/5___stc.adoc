== SSP Traceability Common

This chapter describes in detail the content and structure of the XML schema stc.xsd, which represent common concepts that are reused in the other XML schemas of the specification.
The purpose of extractiong these elements is to increase the flexibility and extensibility of the GlueParticles approach and to help to apply the GlueParticles concept to other topics in product and system engineering.

[#sec-generalinformationtype]
=== GeneralInformationType

This element type is used to encapsulate general information about the simulation or decision task, which is not part of any specific phase or step.

[#sec-derivationchain]
==== DerivationChain

The SSP Traceability data formats DTMD and STMD are primarily intended for the standardized exchange of information packages between tools and partners.
They do not have built-in versioning mechanisms.
The SSP Traceability package represents a snapshot of the used versions of the linked sources and resources.
Versioning of sources and resources is done in the generating tools and data management systems.

The exception is the derivation chain. Each time an STMD or DTMD file is written, a new entry is created in the derivation chain with a unique identifier of the file from which the new instance is derived.
When a tool or data management system receives an SSP Traceability container with STDM, DTMD back, it can check, by comparing the derivation chain with the target system's data infrastructure, which version of the DTMD or STMD was sent.
This serves as a basis for controlling the reintegration of received DTMD STMD and it can be determined what is already available, what has been modified, what is new, etc.

The DerivationChain element can be used to provide the appropriated set of information about files that were used to derive the current file.
If the content of the current file can be considered to be derived from one or a set of other GlueParticle, then the top level meta data and DerivationChain information of those files should be included in their original order as entries in this file's DerivationChain element.

[#sec-lifecycleinformationtype]
=== LifeCycleInformationType

The LifeCycleInformationType element type defines the structure and attributes of life-cycle information about the enclosing phase or step element.

[#im-lifecycleinformationtypeschema]
.LifeCycleInformationType element structure and attributes
image::LifeCycleInformationTypeSchema.png[]

The following life-cycle states are intended for use.
In the following explanations, the term "information to which life-cycle status applies" always refers to a **complete** phase with all of its steps, or to a **complete** step within a phase.
Life-cycle information **never** refers to more than one phase and **never** refers to more than one step within a phase.

* **Drafted:** The information to which the life-cycle status applies represents a draft status and is still in progress.
This can also mean that the information is not complete and is still being finalized.

* **Defined:** The information to which the life-cycle status applies is considered complete and may be subject to review or validation.

* **Validated:** The information to which the life-cycle status applies has been reviewed and validated.

* **Approved:** The information to which the life-cycle status applies has been approved based on review and validation.

* **Archived:** The information to which the life-cycle state applies has been set as valid and remains valid for this instance of the GlueParticle, but may not be reused for similar steps or phases in other GlueParticles (reuse is not allowed).

* **Retracted:** The information to which the life-cycle status applies has been withdrawn and is considered invalid or may need to be revised.

Due to the inherent dependencies of life-cycles, life-cycle information in later phases will depend to some extent on the life-cycle status of earlier phases:
For example, if the Implementation phase is marked as having reached Validated status, there would be a contradiction if the Requirements phase had only reached Drafted status.
Multiple life-cycle information entries may exist to record the historical progression of the life-cycle status, but only the last entry in the document order, which will also be the most recent, is considered valid for the current file contents; earlier states only record historical data.

|===

[#sec-locator]
==== Locator

An extended link indicates resources that participate in it by means of Locator elements.

| xlink:title    | Optional             | This attribute is used to describe the meaning of the resource in a human-readable fashion.
| xlink:role     | Optional             | This attribute supplies semantic information about the locator's resource: The xlink:role attribute indicates a property that the resource has.
|===

[#sec-arc]
==== Arc

An extended link may indicate rules for traversing among its participating resources by means of a series of optional Arc elements.

The traversal attributes (xlink:from and xlink:to) define the desired traversal between pairs of resources that participate in the same link, where the resources are identified by their locator's label attribute values.
The xlink:from attribute defines resources from which traversal may be initiated, that is, starting resources, while the xlink:to attribute defines resources that may be traversed to, that is, ending resources.

The semantic attributes (xlink:title and xlink:arcrole) describe the meaning of the arc's ending resource relative to its starting resource.
The xlink:arcrole attribute corresponds to the RDF notion of a property, where the role can be interpreted as stating that "starting-resource HAS arc-role ending-resource."
This contextual role can differ from the meaning of an ending resource when taken outside the context of this particular arc.
For example, a resource might generically represent a "person," but in the context of a particular arc it might have the role of "mother" and in the context of a different arc it might have the role of "daughter."

When the same resource serves as a starting resource in several arcs (whether in a single link or across many links), traversal-request behavior is unconstrained by this specification, but one possibility for interactive applications is a pop-up menu that lists the relevant arc or link titles.

| xlink:title    | Optional             | This attribute is used to describe the meaning of the arc in a human-readable fashion.
| xlink:arcrole  | Optional             | This attribute supplies semantic information about the arc: The xlink:arcrole attribute indicates a property that the arc relationship has.

| kind           | Mandatory           | This attribute indicates the kind of resource that is referenced, i.e. what role it plays in relation to the particle being described. Recommended value entries are __'document', 'requirement', 'specification', 'model', 'parameter', 'system', 'testcase', 'result', 'method', 'rationale', 'report', 'request', 'delivery', 'executable', 'configuration'__. The meaning of the values are described directly below this table.  If no more precise label applies, the kind __'document'__ can be used.
| scope          | Optional            | This attribute indicates the scope or level that a resource is specific to, i.e. whether the resource applies at a global, system, subsystem or component level.  The use of this attribute is optional, i.e. it should only be specified where it makes sense to give this kind of information.
| type           | Mandatory           | This mandatory attribute specifies the MIME type of the resource, which does not have a default value.  If no specific MIME type can be indicated, then the type application/octet-stream is to be used.
| source         | Optional            | This attribute indicates the source of the resource as a URI (cf. RFC 3986).  For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the GlueParticle.  Therefore for resources that are located alongside the GlueParticle, relative URIs without scheme and authority can and should be used to specify the component sources.  For resources that are packaged inside an SSP that contains this GlueParticle, this is mandatory (in this way, the GlueParticle URIs remain valid after unpacking the SSP into the file system). If the source attribute is missing, the resource is provided inline as contents of the Content element, which must not be present otherwise.
| master         | Optional            | This attribute, if present, indicates the original, canonical master source for the resource. If it is present, it indicates that the content provided via source attribute and/or Content element is only a copy of the original, canonical data, and this attributes provides the URI reference to that original canonical master data.
| id             | Optional            | This attribute gives the model element a file-wide unique id which can be referenced from other elements or via URI fragment identifier. 
| description    | Optional            | This attribute gives a human readable longer description of the model element, which can be shown to the user where appropriate.

List of recommended value entries for the attribute __kind__ with short explanations.

__'document'__:: The Value __'document'__ can be used as a generic resource kind in any case a more specific kind does not fit to the referenced resource.

__'requirement__:: The __'requirement'__ kind value is used to indicate that a resource contains a requirements document, or sets of consistent single requirements without distinguishing between different subjects to which the requirements apply.

__'specification'__:: The __'specification'__ kind value is used to indicate that a resource contain a specifications document , or sets of consistent single specifications without distinguishing between different subjects to which the specifications apply.

__'model'__:: The kind value __'model'__ is used to indicate that a resource contains a simulation model. It does not distinguish between parameterized models, which do not need additional parameters or unparameterized models, which require an additional parameter file.

__'parameter'__:: The kind value __'parameter'__ is used to indicate that a resource contains parameters or sets of consistent parameters for a simulation model.

__'system'__:: A resource of kind __'system'__ is or contains a reference to the s__ystem under test__ in a PDM system or similar IT system or any other kind of description of the __system under test.__

__'testcase'__:: A resource of kind __'testcase'__ should contain information that describe how the simulation objectives are achieved at the operational level by one more test cases. A consistent set of test cases could be considered a technical breakdown of the simulation objectives.#

__'results'__:: #A resource of kind __'result'__ should contain information that answers questions posed by the simulation requester about the goals and intent of the simulation. In principle, this could be any kind of result data, no matter what it actually represents in detail. If the result is intended to be an aggregated and condensed report, the value __'report'__ can be used instead.

__'method'__:: A resource of kind __'method'__ should contain information that describes how a described process step is performed or should be performed.

__'rationale'__:: A resource of kind __'method'__ should contain information about why a related process step is or was performed in the way it was performed. This is especially true for activities that were not performed in the specified way for good reasons, or where assumptions and simplifications were made.

__'report'__:: A resource of kind  __'report'__ should provide information about the requested results in a human-readable report format, i.e., aggregated and condensed to a level that directly relates to the requestor's question or the goals and intent of the simulation.

__'request'__:: A resource of kind __'request'__ should contain information provided by the "requester" to perform the task. The requestor here is synonymous with the parent process or requesting organizational unit.

__'delivery'__:: A resource of kind __'delivery'__ should contain information that provides the "client" with information about the execution of the task and the result of the task.

__'executable'__:: The type value __'executable'__ is used to indicate that a resource contains an executable file, such as a script or an Office file with an executable VBA macro.

__'configuration'__:: A resource of kind __'configuration'__ contains a detailed description of the configuration of the simulation environment setup.


[#sec-summary]
==== Summary

The Summary element provides an optional summary of the resource being referenced.
The summary information is intended for human consumption to get an overview of the resource content without looking at the content itself.
The summary content can be provided inline through the Content element, or it can be provided through the source URI attribute.

| type           | Mandatory            | This mandatory attribute specifies the MIME type of the resource summary, which does not have a default value.  If no specific MIME type can be indicated, then the type application/octet-stream is to be used.  If markdown content is used, then the type text/markdown shall be used. 
| source         | Optional             | This attribute indicates the source of the resource summary as a URI (cf. RFC 3986).  For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the GlueParticle, if the sourceBase attribute is not specified or is specified as GlueParticle, and the URI of the referenced resource if the sourceBase attribute is specified as resource. This allows the specification of summary sources that reside  inside the resource (e.g. an FMU) through relative URIs. For summaries that are located alongside the GlueParticle, relative URIs without scheme and authority can and should be used to specify the summary sources.  For summaries that are packaged inside an SSP that contains this GlueParticle, this is mandatory (in this way, the GlueParticle URIs remain valid after unpacking the SSP into the filesystem). If the source attribute is missing, the summary is provided inline as contents of the Content element, which must not be resent otherwise. 
| sourceBase     | Optional             | Defines the base the source URI is resolved against: If the attribute is missing or is specified as GlueParticle, the source is resolved against the URI of the GlueParticle, if the attribute is specified as resource the URI is resolved against the (resolved) URI of the resource source.

[#sec-resourcereference]
==== ResourceReference

The ResourceReference element is used to reference an existing Resource element, to avoid duplication of information about the resource.
All relevant information about the resource is taken from the referenced Resource element, whereas the ResourceReference element only contains a reference to that Resource element, and additional common administrative information.

Semantically, it is treated as if the referenced Resource element where present instead of the ResourceReference element in its location.
