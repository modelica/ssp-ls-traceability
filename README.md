# SSP LS Traceability

[![Build Specification](https://github.com/modelica/ssp-ls-traceability/workflows/Build%20Specification/badge.svg)](https://github.com/modelica/ssp-ls-traceability/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+Specification%22)

This repository contains the [SSP][]-based layered standard for
simulation traceability information exchange.  Note that this
specification is actively being worked on, and thus subject to
change without notice.

The [specification][spec] is maintained on [GitHub][github] and is
published [here][spec]. It is based on the [SSP 2.0][SSP20] standard,
but usable with both SSP 1.0 and SSP 2.0.

Additional guides are provided [here][guides] and example files are
provided [here][examples].
